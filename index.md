# Welcome to my blog

My plans for this blog are to share my experiences and see the progress I have made over time. 
Since I'm new to the github, I would appreciate some help.
I'm not so good with programming and struggling with school projects :/
My interests are bash and python but I'm some kind of forced to work with C# and Java
So why don't I turn this to an opportunity and learn/practice all of them.
